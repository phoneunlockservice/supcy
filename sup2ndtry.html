          <h3>A Little About Mobile Technology</h3>
          <p>Mobile technology is reshaping society, communications, and the global economy. With cell phones,
            smartphones, and tablets now outnumbering desktop computers, there has been a sea change in the way people
            access, use, and share information. Powerful mobile devices and sophisticated digital applications enable
            users to build businesses, access financial and health care records, communicate with public officials, and
            complete online transactions. More globally, such devices and applications have helped reduce social
            inequality, increased participation in civic life, and increased education levels, all of which spur
            national economic development. </p>
          <p> This revolution in how consumers and businesses access information, and
            the far-reaching consequences of such uses, represents a fundamental turning point in human history. For the
            first time, people are able to connect with one another in a relatively inexpensive and convenient manner
            around the clock. In both developed and developing countries, the growth in mobile technology has been
            accompanied by job creation and knowledge transfer, as well as deepened social and economic connections.
            With
            the mobile industry generating $1.6 trillion in revenues, it is important to understand how mobile telephony
            is reshaping our world--our social connections, economic markets, and political development.</p>

          Our phones are, without a doubt, some of the most important gadgets in our lives. Even with the ever-rising
          need to use our phones almost everywhere, there is one thing that never seems to be addressed correctly –
          effective handling of these slippery pieces of technology. Given the availability of sophisticated mobile
          brands–the challenge to handle these gadgets becomes even more daunting. But no worries, were are here to
          make sure you get the most out of these gadgets thereby minimizing glitches.

      <h2> When is it appropriate to reset my phone to factory settings</h2> <br>
      <img class="centered" src="facrestrue.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="failed to load image">
      <p>There are plenty of reasons why someone would want to do a factory reset on their phone. If your phone is

        dealing with software issues, a factory reset could truly save the day. If it’s moving slowly, glitching often,

        or having other serious problems, a factory reset might be an option to consider. <br>
        <br>
      <h3>What to expect after a factory reset</h3> <br>
      Any operating system issues and major errors that have been occurring on your phone will cease to exist. If you
      have plans to sell your phone to someone else, they won’t be able to access any of your personal information. A
      factory reset is highly suggested for anyone planning to sell their old phone since phones generally carry tons of
      highly personal data — from bank statements to credit card numbers.

      <h2>Why does my phone say "No Sim"? Try these tricks</h2> <br>
      <img class="centered" src="nosimcard.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="failed to load image">
      <p> <strong>Trick 1:</strong> Although it seems like a no-brainer, the first thing to do when an error message
        pops up is to remove
        the SIM card on your phone. Most often, the SIM card message is triggered when a SIM card is loose, not put in
        correctly, or dirty in any way. After taking out the SIM card, wipe it down with a clean cloth or cotton swab
        (but never alcohol, oil, soap, or water!) <br>

        Next, check that the SIM tray isn't dirty or otherwise damaged. If so, you might want to replace the SIM tray.
        If your SIM card is scratched or damaged, typically, the carrier can replace it for a small fee. The best way to
        avoid replacing a SIM card is not to handle the SIM card too much in general. <br>
      </p> <br>
      <p> <strong>Trick 2:</strong> Turning your phone off and on may fix minor SIM card glitches, but if that doesn't
        work, try checking your carrier connection. Typically, carrier connection can be found in most phone Settings
        menus. If you aren't connected to your carrier network, that can cause SIM card problems. Also, make sure to
        keep up with software updates to your phone for the best usability.

      <p>
      <p> <br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> If you've attempted every solution you can think of and those listed here, but
        issue still persist, the SIM card error might
        be an issue with the phone itself. At this point, taking it into a repair store or the manufacturer might be
        best.

        <h2>Why does my phone overheat while charging</h2> <br>
        <img class="centered" src="chargeheat.jpg" width="400px" height="400px"
          alt="failed to load image">
        <p>There are many reasons why your device could overheat while charging. In this guide we'll talk about the most
          common.

        <p> One of the most common reasons that your phone feels like it’s on fire has to do with continuous use. The
          idea
          of shooting out a few text messages while charging your almost lifeless phone may seem like the best way to
          kill two birds with one stone, but it actually does more harm than good.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p> Another thing that could affect the temperature of your phone while charging is where you place your
          plugged-in phone. Placing your phone on a bed, sofa, or any surface where heat dissipation is poor will cause
          your device’s temperature to rise.
        </p>


        <p> Lastly, your phone may overheat while charging if you're running multiple apps during charging. It’s okay
          trying to stay connected for a variety of reasons. However, keeping your apps running will cause your
          power consumption to increase, which will lead to an overheated phone.

        alt="failed to load image">
      <p>

        To do this you'll need a mouse and an OTG cable. <br> <br> Step 1: Connect the Micro USB side or the OTG adapter
        to your
        device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter. <br> <br> Step 2: As soon as the devices are connected,
        you will be
        able to see a pointer on your screen. you can use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the device's
        password lock.
